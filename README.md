# pigplates
some utilities for working with pygplates

- aim is to make some python functions that slightly streamline the use of pygplates compared to calling pygplates functions directly
- still in a primitive state
- general requirements are pygplates, numpy, scipy, pandas - and, for gridded data, netCDF4 and healpy
